I say hello, and talk about what I'm hoping to build in the next couple of months, along with other lifestyle (fashion, home living, food/drinks, music) choices i'm sharing with the public.\n\nHi friends! I'm excited to share this little corner of my world with you – from the plants I'm nurturing to the everyday moments that make life beautiful. Over the next few months, I'm hoping to document the garden I'm building along with all the little things I love: cozy home touches, what I'm cooking, and the music that's been inspiring me lately.\n",
